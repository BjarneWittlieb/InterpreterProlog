```

## Bash methods
When running the interactive Environment, the following methods are supported:

```:h``` for showing a Help window with this list of commands.

```:l <filename>``` to load a Prolog filename into the current system to operate on.

```:s <strategey>``` to switch the strategy which is used to search the dfs tree for solutions.
Available are ```dfs```, ```bfs``` and ```idfs```.

```:q``` to exit the current environment.

```<rule>``` to proof the rule via search of the sld tree.

## Supported Prolog commands

The Engine does not support a full Prolog system.
Only one programm can be loaded at a time, there is not (finite) negation and also the ! (cut-) operator is not implemented.
